# Current stable version: 3.3.02

### July 20, 2012

Just a couple minor improvments:  
- "Wide View" option on Edit page now persists across saves
- Hopefully improved handling of language files.  Kinda' like "online security", "multi-language support" is a nebulous and a bit finicky.
  
- And, thanks again to [codeless](http://github.com/codeless) for the German language file!

# OneFileCMS

## Yes, that's exactly what it is!

OneFileCMS is just that. It's a flat, light, one file CMS (Content Management System) entirely contained in an easy-to-implement, highly customizable, database-less PHP script.

Coupling a utilitarian code editor with basic file managing functions, OneFileCMS can maintain a whole website completely in-browser without any external programs.

## Demo

- Just download & try the current stable version - it's one file!

## Features
 
- All the basic features of an FTP application like renaming, deleting, copying, and uploading
  _(Of course, for more complex processes like batch renaming or mass uploads/deletions, you're going to want to break out an actual FTP program.)_
- Alert if you try to leave without saving your edits.
- A Login delay after too many invalid attempts.
- Adjustable idle time before auto-logout.
- Easily modifiable & re-brandable.
- Possibly the easiest installation process ever!

## Installation

1) Download [this file](https://raw.github.com/Self-Evident/OneFileCMS/master/onefilecms.php).

2) Set your username and password - edit them to something less obvious.

    // CONFIGURATION INFO
    $USERNAME = "username";
    $PASSWORD = "password";

3) Upload to anywhere on your site!

Depending on how your web stack is set up, you may also have to modify the file permissions of your site's folders to allow OneFileCMS to modify and create files. ([More about that here.](http://catcode.com/teachmod/)) Make sure onefilecms.php and its parent folder are allowed to execute, with CHMOD at 755. Check with your host if you're not sure, and be aware of any inherent security concerns.

You can also change the file name of OneFileCMS.php to something else, such as "Admin.php" . _(Be careful making it a folder's default file: your server may get stuck in redirects.)_

## FAQ

### Where's the WYSIWYG? What about syntax highlighting?

WYSWIWYG editors have been requested, but probably won't become standard, as they'd probably make it more than one file, sort of defeating the "OneFile" point. Plus, if you're working in PHP or non-HTML code, they're can be more of a hindrance than an asset.

However, just because I don't want to do it, doesn't mean it's impossible.  Look for the Edit_Page_form() function. Its textarea can be modified to work with whatever editor you like. 

### I found something that could be better. Can I suggest it to you?

Yes, of course!

I may not have the time/bandwidth/inclination to implement every feature, but I'll do what I can. If it's urgent, contact me.  

In anycase, try [forking the file and submitting your changes to me](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button).

### This is basically just a file manager with a text editor. Why is it being called a Content Management System?

Well, because "OneFileFileManagerTextEditor" just doesn't have the same ring to it...

### Multi-Language Support?

Yes!  (But only English, Spanish and German is available so far...)

### Can I have more than one username/password?

Yes!  Well, sort of - indirectly.  Upload or create addional copies of OneFileCMS, but give them different file names.(ie: OneFile1.php and OneFile2.php etc...)  Then, with each copy, maintain different user names and passwords.  Also, so one user does not log out the other, change the session names.  
  
Now, since there is no database or other means of granular control and acess logging, multiple users may be kind of pointless.  On the other hand, having at least one working backup copy of OneFileCMS available is recommended in case the primary copy gets corrupted.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.2+
  (Only tested on versions 5.2.17, 5.3.3, 5.4, and 5.4.3)
- File permission privileges on your host
- Javascript enabled browswer
- And, for OneFileCMS 3+, a browser that supports inline SVG.  
  (Even if your browser doesn't support SVG, OneFileCMS will still work, just without any icons.)

##Needed/potential/upcoming improvements

- With Chrome, and possibly Safari, issue with Edit page: Clicking browser [back] & then browser [forward],  with file changed and not saved. On return (after [forward] clicked), file still has changes, but indicators are green (saved/unchanged). Does not affect FF 7+ or IE 8+.
- Issue with Chrome's XSS filter: Editing some legitimate files with OneFileCMS will trigger the filter and disable much of the javascript provided functionallity, but only while on edit page with such a file, and only after a [Save].
- Connection is not encrypted (doesn't use SSL), so passwords & usernames are sent in clear text during login.  
  (However, this is true of most online login systems, unless SSL or the like is employed.)
- Be aware that only some very basic data & error checking is performed.  (But, it's getting better...)  
  On Windows, for instance, it's possible to create folders that are subsequently inaccessible and undeletable by Windows.  (Yea, I found out the hard way...)
- Anything else?
